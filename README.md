# NHS Scotland A&E Performance Analysis (Power BI)

This project analyses Accident & Emergency (A&E) performance in Scotland using official NHS Scotland open data.

## Objective
To assess whether A&E waiting time delays are primarily driven by seasonal demand or by structural capacity constraints.

## Data Source
- NHS Scotland Open Data – Weekly A&E Activity and Waiting Times

## Tools
- Power BI
- DAX
- Power Query

## Key Metrics
- Percentage of attendances seen within 4 hours
- Percentage waiting over 8 hours
- Percentage waiting over 12 hours
- Total A&E attendances

## Key Insights
- A&E performance remains consistently below target across all years.
- Limited recovery during non-winter months suggests structural pressure rather than purely seasonal effects.
- Significant variation exists between Health Boards, even when accounting for attendance volume.
